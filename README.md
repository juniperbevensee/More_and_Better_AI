# More and Better AI

*Check  out [More And Better AI](moreandbetter.ai) for more information!*

A platform to create and use free, local, and open-source AI models. 

This project demonstrates how to run and manage models locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) by creating an interactive UI with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

The app has a page for running chat-based models and also one for nultimodal models (_llava and bakllava_) for vision.

## Features

- **Model Personalisation**: Create freely.
- **Interactive UI**: Utilize Streamlit (Python) as a user-friendly interface.
- **Local Model Execution**: Run your Ollama models locally without the need for external APIs (except for downloading).
- **Real-time Responses**: Get real-time responses from your models directly in the UI even without access to wifi.

## Installation
