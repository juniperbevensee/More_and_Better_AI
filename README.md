# More and Better AI

A platform to personalise and use free, local, and open-source AI models. 

This project demonstrates how to run and manage models locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) by creating an interactive UI with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

The app has a page for running chat-based models and also one for multimodal models (_llava and bakllava_) for vision.

Additionally, we make it easy to deeply personalise and save new models using system prompts.

## Features

- **Model Personalisation**: Create freely.
- **Interactive UI**: Utilize Streamlit (Python) as a user-friendly interface.
- **Local Model Execution**: Run your Ollama models locally without the need for external APIs (except for downloading).
- **Real-time Responses**: Get real-time responses from your models directly in the UI even without access to wifi.

## Installation

Before running the app, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and install the required packages using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juniperbevensee/More_and_Better_AI.git
```
